# jarvis-_voice-assistant
Jarvis Voice Assistant is a Python-based voice assistant inspired by Iron Man’s Jarvis. It uses speech recognition, text-to-speech, and Python’s built-in modules to interact with users, respond to queries, and perform simple tasks such as opening websites, telling jokes, and reporting the current time.
